      "paragraph1": "In the early hours of October 2, a South Shore Drive apartment building in Chicago was torn apart by a federal raid. Agents from Border Patrol, the FBI, and the ATF stormed the five-story complex with helicopters, armored vehicles, and flash-bang grenades. Families were forced from their homes, zip-tied in the streetâ€”some unclothedâ€”and left outside for hours. By sunrise, all but 37 were released, but residents returned to apartments trashed and a community deeply shaken.",

The platform never stores personal data, automatically deletes reports from the server after one day, and alerts communities within a five-mile radius. With Defroster, people can stay safe, informed, and connectedâ€”while remaining fully anonymous.",
