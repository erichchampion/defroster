Agents from Border Patrol, the FBI, and the ATF stormed the five-story complex with helicopters, armored vehicles, and flash-bang grenades. Families were forced from their homes, zip-tied in the streetâ€”some unclothedâ€”and left outside for hours. By sunrise, all but 37 were released, but residents returned to apartments trashed and a community deeply shaken.",
